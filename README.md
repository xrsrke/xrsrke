### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in particle physics, deep learning, neuroscience, material science, nanoscience, astrophysics and synthetic biology. I have designed my curriculum and study from 4:00 AM to 3:00 PM to get the information into my brain. Last month, I spent [200 hours](https://i.imgur.com/YNhZBEo.png) studying consistently (365/365).

I stream daily on Twitch: [twitch.tv/xrsrke](https://www.twitch.tv/xrsrke)

Currently, I'm working on re-implement Stable Diffusion, [MuZero](https://github.com/xrsrke/muzero), [RLHF](https://github.com/xrsrke/instructGOOSE), [PauliNet](https://github.com/xrsrke/paulinet) from scratch. Most of my work just get started and in progress. So stay tuned!!
Feel free to check them out on my github.

**xrsrke/xrsrke** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
