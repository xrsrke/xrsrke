### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in particle physics, deep learning, neuroscience, material science, nanoscience, astrophysics and synthetic biology. I have designed my curriculum and study from 4:00 AM to 3:00 PM to get the information into my brain. Last month, I spent 200 hours studying consistently (24/7/365).

I am streaming daily on Twitch: [twitch.tv/xrsrke](https://www.twitch.tv/xrsrke)

Currently, I'm working on re-implement Stable Diffusion, [MuZero](https://github.com/xrsrke/muzero), [RLHF](https://github.com/xrsrke/instructGOOSE), [PauliNet](https://github.com/xrsrke/paulinet) from scratch. Most of my work just get started and in progress. So stay tuned!!
Feel free to check them out on my github.

Best way to reach me is discord: neuralink#7014, [twitter/@xariusrke](https://twitter.com/xariusrke) or hello[@]xrs.wtf
