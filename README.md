### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Last month, I spent [200 hours](https://i.imgur.com/YNhZBEo.png) (**no breaks included**) to studying consistently from 4:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

<!-- ![69](./SCR-20230619-nrtd.png) -->

I stream daily on Twitch: [twitch.tv/xrsrke](https://www.twitch.tv/xrsrke) 

Currently, I'm breaking down the implementation of model parallelism in Megatron-LM and GPT-NeoX, and pipeline paralleism in [TorchGPipe](https://github.com/kakaobrain/torchgpipe). I am also working on reimplementing the Zero Redundancy Optimizer and building [an ML pipeline](https://twitter.com/xariusrke/status/1645347102342672384), and learning about [mechanistic interpretability](https://twitter.com/xariusrke/status/1630503779220226053).


Best way to reach me is discord: neuralink, [twitter/@xariusrke](https://twitter.com/xariusrke) or hello[@]xrs.wtf

Currently, I'm working on re-implement Stable Diffusion, [MuZero](https://github.com/xrsrke/muzero), [RLHF](https://github.com/xrsrke/instructGOOSE), [PauliNet](https://github.com/xrsrke/paulinet) from scratch. Most of my work just get started and in progress. So stay tuned!!
Feel free to check them out on my github.
