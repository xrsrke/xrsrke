### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in physics, deep learning, neuroscience, material science, and nanoscience. I have designed my curriculum and study from 4:00 AM to 3:00 PM to get the information into my brain. Last month, I spent 200 hours studying consistently.

Currently, I'm working on re-implement Stable Diffusion, MuZero from scratch. Most of my work just get started and in progress. So stay tuned!!
Feel free to check them out on my github.

I am streaming daily on Twitch: [twitch.tv/xrsrke](https://www.twitch.tv/xrsrke)

Best way to reach me is discord: neuralink#7014
