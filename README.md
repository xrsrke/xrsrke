### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Scaling neural networks to massive scale at ðŸ¤— HuggingFace.

I used to study consistently from 3:30 AM to 3:30 PM. And then go to sleep from 5:20 PM to 2:45 AM (schedule optimized for studying, around 45m to fall asleep) for more than a year (I studied many things before ML). **AND REPEAT.**

I stream daily on Twitch: [twitch.tv/xrsrke](https://www.twitch.tv/xrsrke) 

Currently, I'm building [a library that enables training any ðŸ¤— `transformers` models in 3D parallelism and ZeRO-1 out of the box](https://github.com/xrsrke/pipegoose), and learning about [mechanistic interpretability](https://twitter.com/xariusrke/status/1630503779220226053).


**DMs open**

Best way to reach me is discord: neuralink, [twitter/@xariusrke](https://twitter.com/xariusrke) or hello[@]xrs.wtf

I am interested in particle physics, deep learning, neuroscience, material science, nanoscience, astrophysics and synthetic biology. I have designed my curriculum and study from 4:00 AM to 3:00 PM to get the information into my brain. Last month, I spent [200 hours](https://i.imgur.com/YNhZBEo.png) (no breaks included) studying consistently (365/365).

Currently, I'm working on re-implement Stable Diffusion, [MuZero](https://github.com/xrsrke/muzero), [RLHF](https://github.com/xrsrke/instructGOOSE), [PauliNet](https://github.com/xrsrke/paulinet) from scratch. Most of my work just get started and in progress. So stay tuned!!
Feel free to check them out on my github.

**xrsrke/xrsrke** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
